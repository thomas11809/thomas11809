### Hi there, I'm Sung Ju (Thomas) Lee 👋

<br>

> "Curiosity drives me to explore the frontiers of Al through research, ventures, and art."

<br>

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Vision at Seoul National University, passionate about bridging the gap between theoretical research and real-world applications. My experience extends from authoring an ICCV 2025 paper on semantic watermarking to co-founding two startups where I architected core 3D vision pipelines. I also enjoy applying generative AI to create media art, with my work being featured in exhibitions at the prestigious Seoul Arts Center.
